# BookStore

Hi,

This is a dynamic Web Application for a Book store which stores all the information about books, orders, tracking etc. and renders the information as requested.

For frontend I have used Bootstrap and the backend is coded in Django and the database used is a default Django database i.e. sqlite3.

On this platform user can buy new books, sell their used books and buy old books at cheaper price.

After placing an order user gets an orderId which is used for tracking the order.
